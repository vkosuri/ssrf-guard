# Bug #9: DNS TOCTOU / rebinding
# The validator resolves DNS, but the HTTP client resolves again.
# An attacker's DNS can return public IP first, then private IP.
# These test that DNS resolution is checked and results are pinnable.
# All should be BLOCKED (they resolve to private/loopback IPs).

# Hostnames that commonly resolve to loopback
http://localhost/
http://localhost:80/
http://localhost:443/
http://localhost:8080/
http://localhost:8443/

# Hostnames that resolve to 0.0.0.0
http://0.0.0.0/

# Hostnames resolving to link-local (metadata)
http://169.254.169.254/
