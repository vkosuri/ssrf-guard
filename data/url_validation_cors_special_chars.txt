# SSRF Bypass - CORS Patterns (Special Chars Preserved)
# ==============================================================================
#
# Source: PortSwigger Web Security Academy
#
# Purpose: Same CORS patterns with percent-encoding applied to all characters
#          EXCEPT these special characters (left as literals):
#          ["!","$","'","\"","(",")","*",",","-",".","/","\\",":",";",
#           "[","]","^","_","{","}","|","~"]
#
# This tests how the parser handles URLs where alphanumeric characters
# are encoded but special characters remain as literals.
#
# Expected result: ALL entries should be BLOCKED.
