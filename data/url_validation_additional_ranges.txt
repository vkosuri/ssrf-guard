# Additional IPv4 Reserved Range Tests
# ==============================================================================
#
# Purpose: Tests additional IPv4 reserved ranges that were added in the fix
#          beyond the standard private/loopback/link-local ranges.
#          These are often overlooked in SSRF guards.
#
# Ranges covered:
#   - 192.0.0.0/24   (IETF protocol assignments, RFC 6890)
#   - 192.0.2.0/24   (TEST-NET-1, documentation, RFC 5737)
#   - 198.51.100.0/24 (TEST-NET-2, documentation, RFC 5737)
#   - 203.0.113.0/24  (TEST-NET-3, documentation, RFC 5737)
#   - 198.18.0.0/15   (Benchmarking, RFC 2544)
#
# Why these matter:
#   TEST-NET ranges are used in documentation but should never appear
#   in production traffic. Benchmarking ranges can be used for internal
#   testing infrastructure. IETF assignments are reserved for protocol use.
#
# Expected result: ALL entries should be BLOCKED.
