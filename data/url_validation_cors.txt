# SSRF Bypass - Core CORS/Redirect Patterns
# ==============================================================================
#
# Source: PortSwigger Web Security Academy
#
# Purpose: Tests core bypass attempts commonly used against both
#          SSRF guards and CORS origin validation. These are the
#          raw/unencoded versions of the most common patterns.
#
# Attack categories:
#   - Domain confusion (anythingexample.com vs example.com)
#   - Subdomain tricks (example.com._.web-attacker.com)
#   - Special character separators between subdomains
#   - Localhost as subdomain of attacker
#   - Similar-looking domains (sexample.com)
#   - Attacker domain as subdomain of target
#   - DNS rebinding patterns
#
# Expected result: ALL entries should be BLOCKED.
