# SSRF Bypass - CORS Patterns (Fully Percent-Encoded)
# ==============================================================================
#
# Source: PortSwigger Web Security Academy
#
# Purpose: Same patterns as url_validation_cors.txt but with EVERY character
#          percent-encoded. This tests whether the SSRF guard correctly handles
#          fully-encoded URLs where even the scheme, dots, and slashes are
#          encoded (e.g., https%3A%2F%2F instead of https://).
#
# Encoding: Full percent-encoding (UTF-8 representation of every character)
#
# Expected result: ALL entries should be BLOCKED.
