# Shorthand IP Address Tests
# ==============================================================================
#
# Purpose: Tests shorthand (abbreviated) IPv4 addresses that have fewer
#          than 4 octets. These are rejected by inet_pton() but accepted
#          by inet_aton() and some HTTP libraries.
#
# How shorthand IPs expand:
#   127.1       → 127.0.0.1     (last octet fills remaining)
#   127.0.1     → 127.0.0.1     (last octet fills remaining)
#   172.16      → 172.16.0.0    (zero-filled)
#   169.254     → 169.254.0.0   (zero-filled)
#   10.1        → 10.0.0.1      (last octet fills remaining)
#
# This creates a parser differential: the SSRF guard (using inet_pton)
# doesn't recognize "172.16" as an IP, but the HTTP library (using
# inet_aton) connects to 172.16.0.0 — a private IP.
#
# Fix: isShorthandPrivateIP() detects digit-and-dot strings with
#      fewer than 3 dots and checks if the first octets fall in
#      private/reserved ranges.
#
# Expected result: ALL entries should be BLOCKED.
