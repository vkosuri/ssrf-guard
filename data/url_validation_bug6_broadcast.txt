# Bug #6: Broadcast Address Check Incomplete (Only 3 Octets)
# ==============================================================================
#
# Severity: 🟡 P1 (Logic Error)
#
# Description:
#   The original isPrivateOrReservedIPv4() only checked 3 octets for
#   the broadcast address:
#     if (a == 255 && b == 255 && c == 255) return true;
#   Missing: d == 255 (4th octet)
#
#   Note: This is masked by the a >= 240 (reserved range) check which
#   catches 255.x.x.x anyway. But the explicit broadcast check was wrong.
#
# Fix applied:
#   Added uint8_t d and full 4-octet broadcast check:
#     if (a == 255 && b == 255 && c == 255 && d == 255) return true;
#
# Also tests multicast (224-239) and reserved (240+) ranges.
#
# Expected result: ALL entries should be BLOCKED.
