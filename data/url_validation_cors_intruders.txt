# SSRF Bypass - CORS Patterns (Intruder Percent-Encoded)
# ==============================================================================
#
# Source: PortSwigger Web Security Academy
#
# Purpose: Same CORS patterns encoded using Burp Suite Intruder's default
#          percent-encoding. Encodes all characters EXCEPT Intruder defaults:
#          [" ",".","/","\\","=","<",">","?","+","&","*",";",":","\"",
#           "{","}","|","^","`","#","-"]
#
# This tests parser behavior when some delimiters are encoded and others
# are literal — a common real-world scenario from Burp Intruder scans.
#
# Expected result: ALL entries should be BLOCKED.
